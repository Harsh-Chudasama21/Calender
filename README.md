# Calendar Web App

A simple, interactive calendar web application that allows users to add and visualize events based on date and time. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Event Creation:** Add events by specifying start/end dates, start/end times, and event names.
- **Dynamic Calendar Table:** Automatically generates a calendar grid for September (30 days, 12 hours per day).
- **Event Visualization:** Events are displayed in the calendar grid, spanning the selected date and time range.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, modern look using the Poppins font and custom color scheme.

## Included Files

- `calender.html` — Main HTML file containing the structure and event form.
- `calender.css` — Stylesheet for layout, form, calendar table, and responsive design.
- `calender_app.js` — JavaScript logic for rendering the calendar and handling event input/display.
